MovieLens is a web-based recommender system and virtual community that recommends movies for its users to watch, based on their film preferences using collaborative filtering of members' movie ratings and movie reviews.
Recommender systems are one of the most successful and widespread application of machine learning technologies in business. There is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item.
We aim to create our own movie recommendation system using the “prediction version of problem”. We are going to train our algorithms using the inputs from the kaggle dataset
Movie ratings , using those ratings and an individual’s interest we will recommend them movies. Recommendations will be based on correlation with their previous views and interest.

This data set consists of:
* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
* Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
* Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
This data has been cleaned up – users who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic information were removed from this data set.(currently there are 610 users)
